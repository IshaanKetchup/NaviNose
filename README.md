# Project NaviNose

## Overview
NaviNose was created to address the difficulties in finding reliable and efficient pupil-tracking software for hands-free mouse control. Current pupil-tracking solutions can be challenging to access, with issues such as high initial costs for specialized cameras, dependency on high-resolution input, and demanding setup and calibration processes. Even with these requirements, these solutions often provide limited accuracy, making them time and resource-intensive without guaranteeing satisfactory performance.

## Motivation
The goal of NaviNose is to offer a lightweight, low-cost alternative that uses nose tracking, which requires only a standard webcam. By focusing on nose movement instead of pupils, we eliminate the need for high-quality cameras, making it accessible on most devices while delivering a responsive and user-friendly experience. This approach not only makes mouse control more affordable and approachable but also maintains simplicity and ease of use.

## Future Scope
Moving forward, this project aims to extend hands-free interaction options by exploring alternative body parts for control. For instance:
- **Foot-controlled clicks** could enable users to manage click actions through foot pedals, offering an ergonomic solution for individuals with limited upper body mobility.
- **Eye-tracking click mechanisms** could be revisited if camera technology advances, making pupil tracking more affordable and accurate for mouse clicks.
  
These enhancements could significantly broaden the accessibility of hands-free controls, further reducing the technology barrier and expanding options for diverse user needs.
